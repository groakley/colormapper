## Requirements

- Processing

## Installation

Begin by downloading a .zip folder from the releases [directory](https://github.com/groakley/colormapper/tree/master/releases). Unzip it, and inside there is a directory called "ColorMapPer." This directory must be copied into your Processing directory (if it is not named "ColorMapPer", it will not appear in the Processing IDE). 

For detailed installation instructions for installing contributed libraries visit the official Processing [page](http://wiki.processing.org/w/How_to_Install_a_Contributed_Library).

## Building

Follow the instructions laid out in the [template](https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template) Processing library. You will need to change the path in the resources/build.properties to match the location of your Processing directory.
